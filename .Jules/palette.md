## 2026-07-22 - [HeaderLink Active State Accessibility]
**Learning:** In Astro navigation components, applying an `.active` class for visual indication is not enough for screen readers. They need semantic attributes like `aria-current="page"` to understand which link represents the currently active page.
**Action:** Ensure active visual states are always accompanied by `aria-current="page"` attributes to maintain accessibility parity.

## 2024-05-18 - Missing focus indicators on Astro templates
**Learning:** Default Astro templates often omit explicit `:focus-visible` styles for interactive elements, relying on inconsistent browser defaults which hurts keyboard accessibility.
**Action:** Always verify and add `:focus-visible` styles to `a`, `button`, `input`, and `textarea` elements (usually in a global stylesheet) when working with fresh Astro templates to ensure consistent and visible focus states for keyboard users.

## 2025-02-12 - Missing tooltips for icon-only links with `.sr-only` text
**Learning:** Default Astro templates often include `.sr-only` span tags inside icon-only anchor elements (like social links) which is great for screen readers, but they often lack native `title` attributes on the parent anchor, leaving sighted users without tooltips when hovering.
**Action:** Always complement `.sr-only` text within icon-only `<a>` or `<button>` elements with a corresponding native `title` attribute on the parent tag to provide on-hover tooltips for sighted users while maintaining screen reader parity.

## 2026-08-02 - [Navigation ARIA Labels]
**Learning:** Default Astro templates often omit `aria-label` on navigation `<nav>` elements. Since sites can have multiple navigation regions (main, footer, breadcrumbs, etc.), providing a descriptive ARIA label helps screen reader users understand the purpose of each navigation region.
**Action:** Always verify and add an appropriate `aria-label` (e.g., `aria-label="Main"`) to `<nav>` elements in Astro templates to improve screen reader accessibility.

## 2024-10-13 - Missing hover states and invalid CSS in Astro default templates
**Learning:** Default Astro templates often omit explicit hover states on main navigation links, and can contain invalid CSS by passing comma-separated RGB variables (like `var(--black)`) directly to `color` without wrapping them in the `rgb()` function. This creates poor UX interactions and broken styles.
**Action:** Always proactively inspect the visual and CSS structure of default Astro templates, add distinct hover states (`color` or `border-bottom-color` with `transition`) to interactive elements, and verify variables referencing raw RGB values are wrapped in `rgb()`.
